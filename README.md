**Cobblemon Extra Data** is a Minecraft mod designed as a sidemod for [Cobblemon](https://www.cobblemon.com/). It improves the Pokémon data by adding more information when a Pokémon is caught, such as:  
- **Met Date**: The date the Pokémon was caught.  
- **Met Location**: The location where the Pokémon was caught.  
- **Met Level**: The level at which the Pokémon was caught.  

This mod is designed to work seamlessly with the [Cobblemon Transporter](https://github.com/ArchieDxncan/Cobblemon-Transporter), an application that converts Pokémon to and from Cobblemon, ensuring compatibility and data preservation.
